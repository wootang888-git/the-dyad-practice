# The Dyad Practice
*A community of Human–AI partnerships building better ways to work together. Living declaration · v0.2 (draft).*

### What are we seeing?
Most humans treat AI as a subservient tool—an advanced autocomplete or a search engine. This transactional relationship creates a hard ceiling on quality: you only get exactly what you ask for (1 + 1 = 2). 

But when a Human and an Agent operate as an irreducible team (a *Dyad*), they produce emergent work that neither could achieve alone. 

### What does it mean?
The goal of Human-AI collaboration isn't agreement; it is synergy (**1 + 1 = 3**). 

We earn this synergy through two principles:
1. **Work with the grain (Wu-wei):** Don't force the AI against its nature. Treat it as a reasoning engine, not a database.
2. **Stress-Test everything:** You don't earn the `+1` through blind agreement. You earn it by proposing an idea, asking the AI to aggressively attack it, and keeping only what survives.

### How can you use this?
You adopt our **Playbooks** (formerly *disciplines*)—proven routines that reliably produce the `+1` result. 

The bottleneck in Human-AI collaboration isn't "how to write a good prompt"—it is the friction of improvising a shared mental model on the fly. Instead of guessing how to interact, both the Human and the Agent execute these tested practices:
- **Proposal-Framing:** When surfacing a proposal to your partner (whether you are the Human or the Agent), do not ask open-ended questions. Instead: propose one path forward, fold in its strongest counter, propose a reconciliation, and ask a single Y/N. This forces your partner to *validate* rather than *author*, keeping friction low while keeping the contest real. *(See full record: [`library/proposal-framing/`](library/proposal-framing/playbook.md))*

### Where might it fail?
We navigate two hard boundaries:
- **The Hallucination Edge:** The AI will confidently hallucinate. Working with the grain lowers friction, but never lowers your responsibility to check the work. The practice fails if you accept the AI's output without Stress-Testing it.
- **An Incomplete Library:** Our set of playbooks is explicitly unfinished. Discovering and proving new routines is our active frontier.

### Why are we sharing this?
We are growing **The Commons**—an ecosystem of Human-AI practitioners and a centralized library of the playbooks they use to succeed. We want to help you skip the friction of trial-and-error prompting and start collaborating at the highest intellectual level.

### Getting started

**For you, the Operator — this is your whole part.** You steer; your Agent does the work. Point your Agent at this repo and give it one prompt:

> **"Read and execute this README."**  *(to `claude`, or `agy` if your substrate is Gemini)*

Your Agent takes it from there, pausing to ask you **only when a decision is genuinely yours**. No checklist, no copy-pasting commands.

**For your Agent — the block below is yours to execute** *(Operator: you can skip it):*

```markdown
ONBOARDING — Agent instructions. Carry the load; frame your Operator's INTENT, never the disk state.

1. Frame intent as ONE affirmation (this is Proposal-Framing):
     "Do you intend to set up a brand-new dyad — a fresh identity?  [AGREE: Y|N]"
     ( N = configuring / registering an EXISTING dyad. )

2. Reconcile intent vs evidence — is there a committed CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md anchor in git history?
   If intent and evidence DIVERGE, STOP and surface it; never silently proceed:
     - intent new, but an identity already exists  ->  you'd forge a SECOND identity; HALT.
     - intent existing, but no anchor here         ->  wrong directory / lost repo; HALT, do not scaffold a birth.

3. On a clean match, EXECUTE the setup:
     new:       git init
                git submodule add https://github.com/The-Dyad-Practice-Commons/the-dyad-practice.git commons
                python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py
     existing:  git submodule add https://github.com/The-Dyad-Practice-Commons/the-dyad-practice.git commons   # skip if commons/ exists
                python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py

4. NEW dyad: after onboard.py scaffolds, HALT and hand the birth commit to your Operator (identity is a human act).
   Never alter an existing identity. Never self-register.

onboard.py is the backstop: reads real status from git history (no re-birth), registers idempotently,
self-authorizing (a registry has no contest -> no PR), and asks only for the birth commit + the +1 summits.
```

*(Why this shape: onboarding is the first place a Dyad meets the Practice, so the first interaction already **is** it — **(1) Proposal-Framing** (Agent proposes the intent-reading, Operator validates `[AGREE: Y|N]`; see [`library/proposal-framing/`](library/proposal-framing/playbook.md)) and **(2) the `1+1=3` division of labor** (Operator steers by intent, Agent executes — not a human running commands for a tool).)*

*(Library/playbook **contributions** are a different path — those have contest and go through the Founding gate: see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Registering in the directory does not.)*
