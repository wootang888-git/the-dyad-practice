"""onboard.py — one idempotent command to join The Dyad Practice Commons.

Run from your dyad's repo root:

    python3 commons/scripts/onboard.py

The tool carries the intricacy so you don't have to. It will:

  * Detect whether you are NEW (no committed anchor yet) or EXISTING (your
    anchor is already in git history). State is read from git — never asked.
  * NEVER re-scaffold or re-commit an existing anchor. Your identity
    (birth-hash) is read from history and cannot be altered by this tool —
    so an existing dyad can run it freely with no risk of "re-birth".
  * Register you idempotently. A registry has no contest, so joining is
    SELF-AUTHORIZING (no PR, no gatekeeper) per DIRECTORY.md — you deposit
    your own one file, which can never collide with another dyad's.
  * Ask you for only two genuine judgments, and only when needed: to make the
    BIRTH commit (new dyads), and to declare your +1 summits.

Safe to re-run at any time.
